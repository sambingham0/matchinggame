# Overview

As a software engineer, I am focused on enhancing my skills in web development and gaining a deeper understanding of JavaScript. I created a memory game that allows users to match pairs of cards. This project helps me practice key programming concepts like event handling and manipulating the DOM.

The software I wrote is a memory game where players flip over cards to find matching pairs. It demonstrates my use of JavaScript language features, including ES6 syntax, native array methods, and recursion. 

My purpose for writing this software is to solidify my knowledge of JavaScript and gain practical experience in building an interactive application. I wanted to implement features like a timer and score tracking, which helped me understand how to structure my code effectively.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my primary tool for developing the software. The project was built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic, without using any external libraries or frameworks.

The programming language used is JavaScript, specifically utilizing ES6 features like arrow functions and array methods (such as `map`, `filter`, and `sort`). This helped me write cleaner and more efficient code.

# Future Work

Here are some things I plan to fix, improve, and add in the future:

- Introduce different grid sizes and card counts for varying skill levels.
- Improve the design of the cards and overall appearance of the game.
- Implement a scoring system to save high scores for players.
